For reading any document, one prefers PDF format over any other formats as it is considered as a standard format for any document in our day to day life. We often come across converting any form details or previews on the website in the form of HTML to PDF. For GoLang, understanding such usability, Developers at Mindinventory made an effort for making one HTML to PDF Converter which can be used for converting HTML content to PDF.


## What it is?

It is a repository, integrating which one can offer HTML to PDF Conversion to their customers.

  - ``sudo apt install wkhtmltopdf`` - for Ubuntu

  1. Create a sample HTML file inside of your project.
  
  2. Get go package using the below command for parsing the HTMl template.
     - ``go get github.com/SebastiaanKlippert/go-wkhtmltopdf``
   
  3. Get another go package for converting this html parse data to pdf using the below command.    
     - ``go get html/template``
     
  4. Run below command 
     - ``go run main.go``

###The previous version of golang was deprecated and not supporting the converter library so dependencies are updated with the new updates.

#Steps by step:

- Install ``golang (1.16)``
- Check ``go version`` (Make Sure it is latest = 1.16)
- ``go mod vendor``
- ``go build``


##To Run the project:

- ``go run main.go``

## Update project dependencies 

- ``go get github.com/SebastiaanKlippert/go-wkhtmltopdf`` v1.6.1
- ``go get html/template``


After finish above steps, You can generate pdf file from html. 

**NOTES:** The pdf will be generated in the storage directory. Don't forget to mention your html and pdf path details inside your code. If you want to generate pdf for static data then it is not mandatory to generate another html for clone data. Use that same sample html inside the code.
